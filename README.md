# ☕ Springboard Decision Tree Specialty Coffee Case Study

This project investigates customer behavior to determine who is likely to purchase Hidden Farm Coffee. We apply Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms to develop interpretable and predictive models.

---

## 📊 Objective

Use machine learning classification to predict whether a customer will buy Hidden Farm coffee based on demographic and purchase-related features.
